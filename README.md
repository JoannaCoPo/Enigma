# SELF EVALUATION  

*Functionality*
  I would give myself a 2.8 - I believe that most functionality is there though it possible that a sneaky edge care or even typo slipped by me  

*Object Oriented Programming*  
  2.5 - I think I am improving in this area though it is still a struggle for me. The organization/structure of this project by far took most of my time. In hindsight, I think I overcomplicated, which ate up valuable time that could have been better used (making more robust tests, etc.)

*Ruby Conventions and Mechanic*
  2.9 - I am very proud of what I was able to put together between research and using pry. However, there are a few instances that I followed syntax examples on stackoverflow, and I'm not sure I could replicate the same logic on my own yet.

*Test Driven Development*
  2.8 - while not required the tests would have felt more robust if I had utilized mock/stubs more (I only stubbed to test Date). I generally don't use def_setup so the test blocks are super bulky, though I don't know if that's the norm.
